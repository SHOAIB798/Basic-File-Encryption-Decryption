# Basic-File-Encryption-Decryption
The Basic File Encryption/Decryption project is a Python program that secures sensitive data by converting a text file into unreadable encrypted form and then restoring it back to the original using the same secret key. It is implemented with the cryptography library (Fernet) and demonstrates how encryption ensures data privacy and protection.
